# 134. Gas Station
**难度**：Medium
**标签**：Array,Greedy

## 题目

There are n gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at the ith station is gas[i].
You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs cost[i] of gas to travel from the ith station to its next (i + 1)th station. You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.
Given two integer arrays gas and cost, return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return -1. If there exists a solution, it is guaranteed to be unique.


Example 1:

Input: gas = [1,2,3,4,5], cost = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 3

## 思路
- 让total加上gas-cost，如果小于0了证明当下这个index对应的走不通，则让total重新为0然后移动到下一个

## 代码（Python）

```python
class Solution(object):
    def canCompleteCircuit(self, gas, cost):
        """
        :type gas: List[int]
        :type cost: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        if sum(gas) < sum(cost):
            return -1
        total = 0
        res = 0
        for i in range(len(gas)):
            total += (gas[i]-cost[i])
            if total < 0:
                total = 0
                res = i+1
        return res
  
```
