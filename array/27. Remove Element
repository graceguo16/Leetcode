# 27. Remove Element

**难度**：Easy
**标签**：Array,Two Pointers

## 题目

Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of val in nums in-place. The order of the elements may be changed. Then return the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val.

Consider the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the elements which are not equal to val. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
Return k.
Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3
Output: 2, nums = [2,2,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

## 思路

- slow负责当下要填的最后return，fast负责遍历和val对比
- 如果fast = val，则+1，反之则slow fast都+1
- 遍历条件：slow和fast都比length小

## 代码（Python）

```python
class Solution(object):
    def removeElement(self, nums, val):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type val: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        fast =0
        slow = 0
        while fast < len(nums) and slow < len(nums):
            if nums[fast] == val:
                fast +=1
            else:
                nums[slow] = nums[fast]
                fast +=1
                slow +=1
        return slow
```
