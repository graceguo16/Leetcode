# 392. Is Subsequence

**难度**：Easy
**标签**：Two pointers, String

## 题目

Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).


Example 1:

Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true

## 代码（Python）

```python
class Solution(object):
    def isSubsequence(self, s, t):
        """
        :type s: str
        :type t: str
        :rtype: bool
        """
        if not s:
            return True
        i = 0
        j = 0
        
        while i < len(s) and j < len(t):
            if s[i] == t[j]:
                i+=1
            j +=1
        return i == len(s)
   
```
