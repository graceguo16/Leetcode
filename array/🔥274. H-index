## 题目

Given an array of integers citations where citations[i] is the number of citations a researcher received for their ith paper, return the researcher's h-index.
According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: The h-index is defined as the maximum value of h such that the given researcher has published at least h papers that have each been cited at least h times.

Example 1:

Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively.
Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, their h-index is 3.

## 思路
- 建立一个新的array papercount, papercount[i]引用次数恰好为 i 的论文有几篇
- 假设 citations = [3, 0, 6, 1, 5]，总共有 5 篇文章，我们要准备 6 个桶（索引从 0 到 5）papercount[0]：引用次数为 0 的论文有几篇？
- h = n：我们先假设最好的情况，即所有的论文 ($n$ 篇) 引用次数都 $\ge n$。papers = papercount[n]：这是目前已知的“引用次数 $\ge n$”的论文篇数。


## 代码（Python）

```python
class Solution(object):
    def hIndex(self, citations):
        """
        :type citations: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        n = len(citations)
        papercount = [0] * (n+1)
        for c in citations:
               papercount[min(c,n)]+=1
        papers = papercount[n]
        h = n
        while papers < h:
              h -=1
              papers += papercount[h]
        return h
       
```
