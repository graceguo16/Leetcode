# 122. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II
**难度**：Medium
**标签**：Array,DP,Greedy

## 题目

You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold at most one share of the stock at any time. However, you can sell and buy the stock multiple times on the same day, ensuring you never hold more than one share of the stock.

Find and return the maximum profit you can achieve.

 

Example 1:

Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
Total profit is 4 + 3 = 7.

## 思路
- 画图！！！有时候两边比较也不一定要Two pointers
- i和i-1相比，如果大一些就往profit里面丢，和上一题不同的是这个可以连加

## 代码（Python）

```python
class Solution(object):
    def maxProfit(self, prices):
        """
        :type prices: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        profit = 0
        for i in range(1,len(prices)):
            if prices[i]> prices[i-1]:
                profit += prices[i]-prices[i-1]
        return profit
       
```
