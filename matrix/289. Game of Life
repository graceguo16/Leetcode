## 题目
According to Wikipedia's article: "The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970."

The board is made up of an m x n grid of cells, where each cell has an initial state: live (represented by a 1) or dead (represented by a 0). Each cell interacts with its eight neighbors (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article):

Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies as if caused by under-population.
Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population.
Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
The next state of the board is determined by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state of the m x n grid board. In this process, births and deaths occur simultaneously.

Given the current state of the board, update the board to reflect its next state.

Note that you do not need to return anything.

Example 1:
Input: board = [[0,1,0],[0,0,1],[1,1,1],[0,0,0]]
Output: [[0,0,0],[1,0,1],[0,1,1],[0,1,0]]

## 思路
- 复合状态码：如果 0 和 1 不够用了，就用 2 和 3 来代表“过去是活的、未来要死”等状态。
- 用除了 0 和 1 之外的数字来标记那些即将发生改变的格子：

状态 0：原来死，现在死

状态 1：原来活，现在活

状态 2：原来活，现在变死（即将死亡）

状态 3：原来死，现在变活（即将复活）

这样，当我们在遍历过程中计算邻居数量时，只要看到 1 或 2，就知道它原来是活的。

## 代码（Python）

```python
class Solution(object):
    def gameOfLife(self, board):
        """
        :type board: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: None Do not return anything, modify board in-place instead.
        """
        ROWS, COLS = len(board), len(board[0])

        for r in range(ROWS):
            for c in range(COLS):
                # 1. 计算当前格子周围 8 个邻居中，活细胞的数量
                nei_count = 0
                for i in range(r - 1, r + 2):
                    for j in range(c - 1, c + 2):
                        # 排除自身，并确保不越界
                        if (i == r and j == c) or i < 0 or j < 0 or i == ROWS or j == COLS:
                            continue
                        # 如果邻居原来的状态是 1 或 2，说明它原来是活的
                        if board[i][j] in [1, 2]:
                            nei_count += 1
                
                # 2. 根据规则标记复合状态
                if board[r][c] == 1:
                    # 规则 1 & 3：活细胞邻居少于2或多于3，则变死
                    if nei_count < 2 or nei_count > 3:
                        board[r][c] = 2
                else:
                    # 规则 4：死细胞邻居刚好有3个，则变活
                    if nei_count == 3:
                        board[r][c] = 3

        # 3. 最后一次遍历，将复合状态转换为最终的 0 和 1
        for r in range(ROWS):
            for c in range(COLS):
                if board[r][c] == 1 or board[r][c] == 3:
                    board[r][c] = 1
                else:
                    board[r][c] = 0
