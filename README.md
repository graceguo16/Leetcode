# LeetCode 150 Practice Log (^-^)

This repository documents my journey through the **LeetCode Top 150 Interview Questions**.

I created this repo as a **learning log**, not just a collection of final answers. Since this is my first time systematically practicing algorithm problems, each solution reflects my real thinking process — including confusion, trial and error, and gradual improvement.

## 📌 What This Repository Contains

For **each problem**, I record:

- **Problem description**
- **My thought process / approach**
- **Implementation (code)**
- **My questions towards specific lines and explanation for understanding**
-  **Time complexity analysis**
-  **Space complexity analysis**

The goal is to make every solution **understandable to my future self**, not just “accepted by LeetCode”.

---

## 🎯 Why I Built This Repo

- To build **algorithmic thinking from scratch**
- To track my **progress and patterns of improvement**
- To practice explaining solutions clearly, not just writing code
- To create a reference I can revisit and refine later

Some solutions may not be the most optimal at first — and that is intentional. Optimization is part of learning.

## A Note to Myself 🐰

> Learning something new means my brain is building **new neural connections**.  
> When something feels difficult, it doesn’t mean I'm not smart enough —  
> it just means my brain hasn’t seen it enough times yet.  
> Difficulty is a sign of unfamiliarity, not inability.  
>  
> So keep going. Repetition works. Understanding grows. 🍀

## Ongoing Work 

This repository will continue to be updated as I:

- Revisit problems with better approaches
- Add alternative solutions
- Improve explanations and complexity analysis

---

## Final Thought

This repo is proof that **learning is allowed to be slow, messy, and imperfect**.  
Consistency matters more than speed.

If you’re on a similar journey — you’re not alone. Keep practicing.
